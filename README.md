YOU MUST HAVE AUTOHOTKEY INSTALLED TO USE THIS SCRIPT.
DOWNLOAD AUTOHOTKEY [HERE](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

Once you have autohotkey installed, simply open the script and use the hotkeys to activate the script.

There are two versions of the script, one for use within a League of Legends game, and one for use outside of game.
The in game version uses your enter key as a trigger and replaces any subsequent text with Ĺ9 WÃR1ØRÐ TÊXT.
The version which runs outside of game uses alt + home as a toggle.

If your keyboard does not have a home key, you can edit the script to change

!Home::Suspend
to something like
!p::Suspend

Which will make the hotkey alt + p to toggle the script.
